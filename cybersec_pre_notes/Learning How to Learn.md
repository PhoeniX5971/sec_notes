# Learning How to Learn

## Core Principles  
1. **Meta-Learning > Rote Learning**  
   - Focus on *how* to learn before *what* to learn.  
   - **Example**: The "3D cake cut" puzzle teaches:  
     - Default thinking = 2D → fails  
     - **Solution**: Visualize vertically (3D) → 8 equal slices with 3 cuts  

2. **SMART Goals** (Task 1)  
   - **Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound**  
   - *Cybersecurity example*:  
     - "~~Learn hacking~~" → "Master SQLi via PortSwigger labs by Month 3"  

3. **80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**  
   - 20% effort → 80% results (e.g., learn core OWASP Top 10 vs. every vuln) 

## Learning Techniques  
| Technique        | Retention Rate | How-To                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Passive (Video)  | 20%            | Watch → Take notes                                |
| Active (Lab)     | 75%            | Do labs → Discuss mistakes                        |
| Feynman (Task 2) | 90%            | Teach imaginary student → Gaps reveal weak points |

## Productivity Hacks  
- **Pomodoro**: 25m focus (zero distractions) → 5m break  
- **Note-Taking Apps**: **Obsidian** (linked notes) > linear docs  
- **Practice**: Re-do labs → Add 1 new vuln variant each time  

## Asking Better Questions (Task 4)  
- **Bad**: "How to hack?"  
- **Good**: "How to exploit FTP anonymous login on X server?"  
- **Pro Tip**: Use ChatGPT to refine questions ("Act as a pentester...")  

## Common Pitfalls  
- **Illusion of Competence**: Environment shapes thinking (e.g., 2D cake trap)  
- **Distractions**: Phone = #1 focus killer.
- **Overlearning**: You *don’t* need 100% mastery to start.
