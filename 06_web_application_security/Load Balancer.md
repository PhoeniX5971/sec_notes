# Load Balancer

For large servers, at some point we might need to create multiple servers instead of one big server for easier scalability.


**Traffic Distribution**: Load balancers efficiently distribute incoming traffic onto the servers.

So they offer high reliability and availability.

They offer:

- Scalability
- Health Checks (for the backend servers)
