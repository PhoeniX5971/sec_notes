# Ports and Services

A network provides it's services through ports.

**Common Ports**:
- Port 22 - SSH (Secure SHell)
- Port 25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- Port 53 - DNS (Domain Name Server)
- Port 80 - HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
- Port 443 - HTTPS

**Why Care**?
Open ports are like unlocked entry points to a service.
Open ports do not mean that there is a vulnerability, they are just the access to the network service, so the vulnerability would be in the service itself (or network).
