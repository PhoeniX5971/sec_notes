# IDS and Defensive Team

Blue teams exist to protect, and just like offensive teams can use nmap, defensive teams can do the same.

Defenders use a lot of techniques including Intrusion Protection System (IPS) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

IDS only detects and logs.
IPS actively blocks intruders.

SNORT IDS/IPS
