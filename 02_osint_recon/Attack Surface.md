# Attack Surface

In recon our job is to understand the **scope** of our attack, and the **potential vulnerabilities** that we might find.

You might also find **forgetten/unmaintained** infrastructure. 

Typically focus on:

- **Domains/Subdomains**
- **IP-Ranges/ASNs/Network Services**

> We need to find all subdomains, ip addresses, network services, open ports...
