# Auth Factors

Auth factors could be:
- Knowledge that only the user know (passwords, pins...)
- Ownership (id cards and such)
- Inherence (biometrics)

> We do not share biometrics over network bcz if they get leaked they can't be changed like a password (unless ur fine with cutting ur fingers off :>)
