# Dictionary Attack

Brute forcing, some databases were made for known hashes, and for the most common passwords.

---
A problem with hashes is that if two people are using the same password, the hash would be the same for both of them, which might lead the attacker into thinking about using dictionary attacks as the password doesn't seem to be unique for a person, so it might be a common password that might be alr on some database.
