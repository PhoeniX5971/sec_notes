# Red and Blue

**Red** team, attacking side. They are a team selected by the company, their job is to find a way to hack into the organization, and report their findings to make the organization more secure.

**Blue** team, defending side. Their job is to defend the organization and block/patch any exploit. They are tasked with designing the systems of the organization in a secured way, or securing an already made system. They are also supposed to handle attacks properly.

**Purple** team, a middle ground, in between both teams. They are supposed to do both jobs.
