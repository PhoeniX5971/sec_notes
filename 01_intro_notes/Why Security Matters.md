# Why Security Matters

## Ubiquitous Computing

- Personal devices
- Embedded Systems
- Smart/IoT devices.

> Computers are everywhere...

## Always Online

We are always connected to a form of network, be it wifi, ethernet connections, or mobile connections... Which means that location information is almost always present.

> You can already imagine how bad it is to be traceable at all times...

## Online Services

Or using the cloud, basically any form of data storage and such...

> Our data isn't only for us, it is also stored somewhere online...

## High Level Complexity

Using high level programming is really helpful for production, however, this complexity of frameworks poses a threat to how much we know on security.

> Who is to say that this framework is completely safe...

## Human Error

Unaware employees pose high risks, even to the most secured system. Humans are highly manipulate-able, can be black-mailed and such.

## Consequences of Attacks

**Financial Loss**: Be it from the attack itself, or from after-taxes due to endangering consumer data. Recovery also requires huge sums of money to get a business back online.

**Productivity Loss**: Loss in productivity of the business for variable reasons and disrupting the business.

**Reputation Damage**: In the business world, reputation is one of the most important asset to a company, losing it's reputation to an attack means that the business will go down and suffer huge losses.
