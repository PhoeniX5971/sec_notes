# README

Notes for cyber security.

You can find the notes in modules.

Linker files have everything inside of them.

PDFs section are compiled sections from the exact notes, so you get everything in the form of pdfs. I also compiled cheat sheets into the pdfs section.

There is also tools section.

> This uses obsidian markdown format.
