*Why this matters for cybersecurity*:  
- **Attack Surface**: 90% of breaches start via networks (phishing, MITM, misconfigs).  
- **Defense**: Firewalls, IDS, and encryption operate at specific network layers ([[OSI Model]]).  
- **Hacker POV**: You must understand traffic flow to exploit/protect systems.
