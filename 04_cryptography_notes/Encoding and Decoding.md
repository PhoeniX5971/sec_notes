# Encoding and Decoding

Encoding and Decoding differ from Encryption and Decryption.

Encoding puts a data and labels it in a know format.
Decoding gets the data back from that known format.

Encryption is a type of encoding, but is a lot more complex, and uses a key to "encrypt" the data where the data would be encoded with added variability to secure it.
Decryption would decode that data using the access key.
